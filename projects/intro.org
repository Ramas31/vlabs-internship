** Components of web application
A web application consists of two parts: server side and client side.  Client
side provides an interface for the interaction between the machine and the
user.  It consists of a browser and client side application. Server side
provides the contents of the application with the help of the database. 
*  Software Development Life Cycle
**  Requirement Determination and analysis 
This phase of software development is to document all the neccessary features
and functions required in the application.

Example:

-User can be of two types: user and admin

-Every User is associated with unique email-id and name

-admin can create and delete User

-user can update, view and update details 

-user can have more than one session

**  Software Design and data model
Here the system design that satisfies all the specifiactions mentioned in the
document of requirements

Example:

Relations and Cardinality:

-Every User has exactly one email-id and every email-id is associated with
atmost one User. [email, user] : User? > Email!

-Every User has exactly one name and every name may be associated with 
at least one User. [name, user] : User > Name!

-Every User has exactly one role and every role may be associated with
at least one User. [role, user] : User? > Role!

-Every User may be associated at least one session and every session is associated with
exactly one User. [email, user] : User! >Session


Primary Entity set:
UserSet, SessionSet

Applying Relation to Sets: 
EmailSet, NameSet, RoleSet, Logged-in-user-set, logged in user-role-set 

State structure and Type structure 


**  Implementation

**  Deployment 
* List of Technologies
- [[https://www.python.org][Python]] :: Python will be main language of implementation in this project
